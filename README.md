### Project Highlights
  * Identified states that model the driving agent and environment, along with a sound justification.
  * Implemented Q-Learining algorithm for driving agent to choose the best action.
  * Implemented epsilon-greedy strategy in order to search all the state space.
  * Tuned parameters of Q-Learning to find the optimal policy. 
  
### General Descriptions
  * Leveraged reinforcement techniques to train a smartcab how to drive in an idealized grid-like city, with roads going North-South and East-West.
